# Inkproved - examples

### Basic
Very raw example using the raw The Intercept story.

It just show you how to work with a very basic Inkproved file.

### Basic - Bottom choices
A small improvement in Inkproved: if an element **ink__choices** exists in **ink__container**, all choices will be inserted into it rather than in the story flow.

### Basic - Tester
Similar to the default Inky export, the tester script is ading a control bar on top, with buttons to restart, go back to previous story node, and a bit of styling to define each block of content easily.

### Basic - Themes
Adds a "choose theme" block on top right to change between theme using *_INK.setTheme()* function, and to help you with all CSS classes in case you need to create your own theme.

### Tags
A complete guide written in Ink on how to use **TAGS** in Ink with *Inkproved*, with an example for each tag.
