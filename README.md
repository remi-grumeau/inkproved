# Inkproved
Yet another version of the [Inky editor](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) web export, focusing to ease creating interactive stories on the web for non-techies, yet adding plugins specifically for the web.

See [examples](https://github.com/remi-grumeau/inkproved/tree/main/examples) for more info.

*Check the [official Inkle Ink tools collection](https://github.com/inkle/ink-library/) for any other languages. For NodeJS/React lovers, you should give [Atrament Preact](https://github.com/technix/atrament-preact-ui) a look*
